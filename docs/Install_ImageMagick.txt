ImageMagick Installation

1. Open PHPInfo and check:
   Architecture = x86 or x64
   Thread Safety = yes or no

2. Download ImageMagick from:

   http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/deps/

   In my case I downloaded: ImageMagick-6.9.3-7-vc14-x86.zip
   because the Architecture under PHPInfo is x86
   as for vc14
   search google for "visual c++ 14 runtime" and install it

3. Unzip and copy all dlls from the bin subfolder to the
    Apache bin directory. It's a bunch of CORE_RL_*.dll
    and IM_MOD_RL_*.dll plus a few other dlls.

4. Goto:

    http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick

    as of today, latest is 3.4.1 so I went to:
    http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick/3.4.1/windows

    For example if you're PHP version is: 7.0.0, and Thread Safety is Yes from
    Step #1, download:
		7.0 Thread Safe (TS) x86

5. Unzip and copy "php_imagick.dll" to the php extension folder:

    For example:
    php_imagick.dll --> C:\xampp\php\ext

6. Edit "php.ini" and add at the very end:

      [Imagick]
      extension=php_imagick.dll

7. Restart Apache

8. Check PHPInfo
    scroll to section (or find): imagick   
    number of supported formats: 234

    If there is no "imagick" section or "supported format" is 0,
    something went wrong.
